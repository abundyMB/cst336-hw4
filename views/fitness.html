                    A common trend that has taken hold over the last few years is 
                    the use of smart fitness devices, most often found in wearables, 
                    like FitBit or iWatch. These devices are used in conjunction with 
                    ye olde workouts of yore. 
                </p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>
                    Other IoT devices allow for a more immersive workout. Whether this 
                    is through participation in fitness classes with smart bikes like 
                    Peloton, creating a leaderboard-like system where users can see 
                    each other&apos;s stats and compete against themselves and each other,
                    or even utilizing virtual reality to allow runners on treadmills to
                    jog through breathtaking vistas.
